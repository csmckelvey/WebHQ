										<span class="bold">I work on web sites and web apps for a living, surely I can make something simple for myself right?</span>At least that's how
										I look at it - what you see before you is the result. And don't forget, as always, it's a work in progress.
										<!-- 
										This is a client side only SPA (Single Page Application) developed with bootstrap and vanilla js ... with a little help from jQuery :]<br />
										So far I have not really done anything specific for mobile platforms, but rather designed the bootstrap layout to handle it gracefully for me.
										<br /><br />
										After purchasing a domain I decided to host the webpage myself from my home. For the sake of uptime and consistency I did not want to
										run the web server from my personal desktop. Instead, I bought and configured a Raspberry Pi 3, Model B to do the job. Not only does it 
										run a Debian derivative (Raspbian) by default, which works well with established software, but it is quite low power and I don't feel like
										an energy leech whenever I leave it running.
										<br /><br />
										As you may have already guessed, I deploy to a standard LAMP stack on the RPi. Apache 2, MySQL 5.7, and PHP 5 on top of Raspbian. As of now 
										the PHP and MySQL servers are only used for testing and other projects.
										<br /><br />
										The navigation hovering (non-mobile only, sorry) is done by adding and removing css classes. The slight animation is provided by the css 
										property <span class="codeSpan">transition: font-size 0.1s;</span> which gets triggered any time the font size changes.
										<br /><br />
										Navigation, as well as content hiding and showing, is done by using jQuery's <span class="codeSpan">slide()</span> functionality - slide up 
										the current panel, slide down the requested one.
										<br /><br />
										This is also the first time I have ever tried to style something like the browser's scrollbar :]

									I also served as a member of the Software Quality Review Board (SQR or 'Square' Board) for 6 months. Now called the R2D2 Board,
									this initiative was started by myself and the other members of the Mindteck Academy team. Its main purpose is to provide high 
									quality deliverables for project team members to help them create a better product at the code level by creating new 
									documentation and updating the old. Along with topics like code quality, formatting, and performance we also featured a 
									developer feedback system by which any project team member could suggest code changes and provide useful tips and tricks. These 
									suggestions were then included in a monthly newsletter for the building to enjoy.

									The focus was on J2EE and applying common programming skills and practices to enterprise level problems and solutions - all while trying

									of both lectures and hands on exercises, both alone and in teams. For the last 4 weeks I worked on a team of 4 to create a prototype web
