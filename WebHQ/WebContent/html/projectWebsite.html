												<span class="bold">I work on web sites and web apps for a living, surely I can make something simple for myself right?</span><br />At least that's how
												I look at it - what you see before you is the result. And don't forget, as always, it's a work in progress.

												This website is developed with bootstrap and vanilla js ... with a little help from jQuery :] So far I have not really done anything specific for 
												mobile platforms, but rather designed the bootstrap layout to handle it gracefully for me. Hopefully I can write up a bit more about it later. For
												now it should be sufficient to say that I have made heavy use of bootstrap's container/grid system. Each page is divided into 12 columns and through
												css classes I can indicate how many columns a particular element should stretch across. By defining different classes for different screen sizes I
												can gracefully handle most standard situations on mobile devices. This helps to make the site more accessible to more people with close to no extra work.

												The navigation hovering effect (non-mobile only, sorry) is done by adding and removing css classes. The slight animation is provided by the css 
												property <span class="codeSpan">transition: font-size 0.1s;</span> which gets triggered any time the font size changes. For very simple animations
												I think this type of css approach is a lot better because you don't bloat your HTML with a bunch of ids and classes and you don't have to worry about
												maintaining extra javascript functions. It's likely that the element already has some css applied and so adding 1 more attribute is pretty painless.
												<br /><br />
												Navigation, as well as content hiding and showing, is done by using jQuery's <span class="codeSpan">slide()</span> functionality - slide up 
												the current panel, slide down the requested one.
